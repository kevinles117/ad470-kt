# ad470-kt

This is the branch that will have several different purposes
1. I will create a dataset that will be used for testing
  a. in order to prevent merge conflicts, I will not be pushing the dataset and instead adding it to the .gitignore
2. I will be adding the training model to the .ipynb file

First thing that needs to get done:
1. Need to get the dataset from the directory and store it into a variable
2. Need to part of the dataset and turn 80% into the training and 20% into the testing
  a. for servals
  b. for cats
